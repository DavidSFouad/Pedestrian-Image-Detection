This code is meant for Training a Pedestrian Detector using INRIA Person Dataset.
dataset can be downloaded from here https://drive.google.com/file/d/14GD_pBpBsprPiZlkmtXN_y5K72To16if/view
For training i didn't use the whole INRIA Person Dataset, i used 689 negative images (images that does not contain pedestrians) and 866 positive images (images that contain pedestrians)
